# FastAPI Blogging Project

## Motivation
To learn the basic concepts and workflow of **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**.

## Features
- Users can **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete** posts.

## Security
- Proper user authentication is not implemented yet but I plan to add it after learning how to build an authentication system using **FastAPI**.  
- Only a specific user will be able to manage posts (Create, Update, and Delete).  
- Visitors will only be able to read and comment on posts.

## Used Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Backend:** FastAPI  
- **Frontend:** HTML  
- **Database:** MongoDB
